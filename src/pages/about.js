            Welcome to my  lil website!
          </p>

          <p className='py-2'>Iâ€™m Vikram (he/him), currently an SDET @ Bungie working over on Marathon. I've previously built a wide array of gamedev related projects focused on networking.
          </p>

          <p className='py-2'>
            Outside of work you can find me trail running, trying to replicate my restaurant foods at home, or just wandering somewhere out in the hills with my wife & my dog. I love walking everywhere & truly love food so please send recs :) If you ever want to connect feel free to reach out to me!
